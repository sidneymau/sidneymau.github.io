            As a white male, I recognize both the enormous privelege I have had in navigating my career as well as my imperative to serve as an ally to those who are under-priveleged in these spaces.
            As I begin my graduate studies, I am looking to explore ways I can engage in public outreach, broaden accessibility to science, and advocate for and advance systemic change towards equity and inclusivity in physics.

            I volunteered as an instructor and program developer for the <a class="link blue dim" href="https://kicp.uchicago.edu/education/explorers/">Space Explorers</a> program with the <a class="link blue dim" href="https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/">Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics</a> at UChicago for the two years during my undergraduate studies.
            This program focuses on providing hands-on experience with physics for under-represented minorities in high school.
            These students come from a diverse range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds across the Chicago Public Schools system, allowing me to reach students who otherwise have few opportunities to grow as potential researchers and scientists.
            As part of the Space Explorers program, I developed hands-on projects for the students that focused on growing their familiarity and confidence in STEM.
            These projects ranged from disassembling and understanding flashlights that operate via shaking magnets through inductive circuits to programming robot car kits to navigate mazes using Arduino microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensor input.
          </p>
          <p>
            I served as a leading volunteer during the program itself, constructing an organizational website and designing and delivering an introductory programming tutorial to the students that served as the basis for their projects throughout the week.
            As part of these projects, we emphasized how bias can factor into the decisions made by artificial intelligences, encouraging the students to approach data-driven research with socially conscious mindsets and emphasizing the implications of these technologies for society.

            At the end of my second year at UChicago, I solicited feedback from my peers in the physics major regarding the physics department curriculum and coursework.
            I compiled this feedback and submitted it to the physics faculty curriculum review committee, who have since used it to inform recent changes in the curriculum.
