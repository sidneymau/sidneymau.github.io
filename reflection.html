            I was born and grew up in the town of Neenah, Wisconsin—an environment that was 98.19% white and 0.04% black.
            Many of the boys around me aspired to become engineers and scientists, following their fathers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My own family was somewhat anomalous.
            While part of the white majority, we were liberal, did not attend church, and were supported by a working mother and a stay-at-home father.
            My mother worked as a designer, and my father had trained as an architect, photographer, and wood crafter; my brother and I grew up surrounded by art and artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, we gravitated towards the arts, spending our days drawing and painting.
            This was generally frowned upon by our peers—particularly the male ones—for being too feminine and not productive in society.
            This tension became the kernel for my own personal distancing from STEM as a whole; the community felt unwelcoming, critical, and intolerant of deviations from their norm.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not until my junior year of high school, taking AP Physics for a graduation requirement, that I gave the subject any attention.
            To my surprise, I found that I truly enjoyed the subject and the work involved.
            Physics soon became my main focus, and I immersed myself in as much as I could, ultimately majoring in the subject in university and thriving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was lucky.
          </p>
          <p>
            And male.
          </p>
          <p>
            And white.
          </p>
          <p>
            My teacher was fantastic, as both a mentor and a friend, and he provided me with many opportunities to excel in both classwork and extra-curricular research.
            Many teachers are not so supportive.
Moreover, many teachers' support depends (many times subconsciously) on the student's gender or the color of their skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Had I had a different teacher and been born female and/or black, it is unlikely that I would be where I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not because of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not because of ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I have trained and matured as a physicist, I have come to realize that my initial assessment of the field—of STEM in general—has in many ways held true.
            Those who are not white men like myself contend with prejudice and discrimination, beginning at the earliest ages and continuing throughout their careers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a status quo that I believe must be changed, and that I have both an <i>imperative</i> and a <i>responsibility</i> to do my part in dismantling.
